											<h3>Robotic Handover Project</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When I joined the TARS Lab at Clarkson, I was first assigned to help the graduate 
											students who were working on the Robotic Handover Project, which was a computer vision
											project designed to better understand human to human
											handover. The goal of this was to help produce seamless robot to human handover,
											which was intuitive and natural for the human. During my time on the project, I assisted with the assembly of one of the many iterations of a cubic capture
											rig which gathered data from over 10 high speed cameras across 3 modalities. In addition, I helped
											run experiments in which subjects would pass common household objects between each other. Following that,
											I assisted in the annotation of the capture data, completing various tasks such as key frame annotation. 
											Although I did less data intensive tasks on the robotic handover project, my time with the project was
											monumental in building my appreciation for working with large data, and the intricacies of maintaining
											control and accuracy in running the experiment, as well as the massive computational load that working
											with computer vision data demanded. Click the image above to visit the publication's website.

											<h3>Broken Object Repair</h3>
										</header>
										<p>After my work on the Robotic Handover Project, I was offered the opportunity to work full time for
											a summer at the lab, assisting with a project which was developing algorithms aimed at taking dense
											3d scans of broken, everyday objects, and producing 3d printed repair parts for the object. My work
											here was more personalized, and I was set in charge of growing the dataset of both complete object 3d
											scans, as well as fractured and broken 3d scans of objects set to be repaired. Furthermore, I was
											in charge of the organization and maintaining of the dataset of hundreds of 3d models, and much of my
											work involved pre and post processing of the objects and models. My efforts there culminated in writing
											and being named an author on the project's dataset paper which earned acceptance at the IEEE/CVF 
											Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, the highest ranking computer science venue
											in the world, and the 4th most cited research publication. This project was incredibly influential in
											my development as a computer science student, and only grew my appreciation for the development of
											and effort working with large datasets, as well as the beauty in drawing meaningful 
											insights from incredibly dense and intensive forms of data. Click the image above to be taken to the paper's
											webpage.
