						<h2> As a freshman in university, I discovered in myself <br />
						a passion for software, and made a change from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science.
						</h2>
						<p>During my sophmore year, I joined a Computer Vision and Machine Learning lab at Clarkson called the 
						<br /> 
						Terascale All-Sensing Research Studio (TARS). It was there that I developed a love for working with data,
						<br /> 
						and discovered the satisfaction of being able to draw logical conclusions and make meaningful analyses
						<br />
						from large data. From then on, most of my college years were spent pursuing my long standing passion
						<br />
						for rock and ice climbing as well as my newfound passions of programming, data and machine learning.

												<h3>Outdoor Enthusiast</h3>
											</header>
											<p>My oldest passion, which has been a part of me since I was 11 years old, 
												is my love for rock climbing, which later evolved to include ice climbing, as well as my
												passion for teaching others how to safely conquer the cliffs of the Adirondack Mountains. 
												See below for the ways in which I've directed my passion.</p>

											<h3>National Outdoor Leadership School</h3>
										</header>
										<p>At the age of 10, I first walked into my local climbing gym for my birthday party, 
										though if you asked me at the time I would have never gone back. However, at the suggestion
										of my father I eventually returned, and slowly he helped me foster a love for rock climbing 
										that persists to this day. When I was 16, after 5 years of absorbing all the technical knowledge I could
										from the outdoor guides who ran the climbing gym, I embarked on a 30 day rock climbing and backpacking trip 
										with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) in the backcountry of the Wind River Range in WY.
										While 5 years of outdoor climbing had prepared me well for the technical goals of the course, 
										the trip was incredibly influential in my development as a leader, team member, problem solver and critical thinker,
										and provided me with the confidence, personal and team skills, and drive to excel not only in my 
										climbing, but in my professional endeavors as well.</p>

											<h3>Clarkson University Outing Club</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When I enrolled at Clarkson, it was not the engineering program that truly drew me to the small
											university in Upstate New York. Instead, I was enthralled when I met the university's Outing Club,
											and the seemingless endless number of likeminded outdoor enthusiasts. Coupled with the location,
											which was only a few hours north of my local Adirondack Mountains, the Outing Club provided the perfect
											respite from the stresses of college. In addition, it allowed me an opportunity to continue my favorite
											aspect(?) of climbing, which was teaching others about safely and efficiently climbing in the outdoors.
											I immediately began teaching fellow club members the guiding, climbing, and rescue skills that
											I had learned, before being elected as one of the officers for the climbing
											cage of our club. In conjunction with that, I worked as a route setter at our university's
											new climbing wall, continuing my love for sharing climbing with every new climber who walked through 
											the door.</p>

											<h3>Robotic Handover Project</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When I joined the TARS Lab at Clarkson, I was first assigned to help the graduate 
											students who were working on the Robotic Handover Project, which was a computer vision
											project designed to better understand human to human
											handover. The goal of this was to help produce seamless robot to human handover,
											which was intuitive and natural for the human. During my time on the project, I assisted with the assembly of one of the many iterations of a cubic capture
											rig which gathered data from over 10 high speed cameras across 3 modalities. In addition, I helped
											run experiments in which subjects would pass common household objects between each other. Following that,
											I assisted in the annotation of the capture data, completing various tasks such as key frame annotation. 
											Although I did less data intensive tasks on the robotic handover project, my time with the project was
											monumental in building my appreciation for working with large data, and the intricacies of maintaining
											control and accuracy in running the experiment, as well as the massive computational load that working
											with computer vision data demanded.

											<h3>Broken Object Repair</h3>
										</header>
										<p>After my work on the Robotic Handover Project, I was offered the opportunity to work full time for
											a summer at the lab, assisting with a project which was developing algorithms aimed at taking dense
											3d scans of broken, everyday objects, and producing 3d printed repair parts for the object. My work
											here was more personalized, and I was set in charge of growing the dataset of both complete object 3d
											scans, as well as fractured and broken 3d scans of objects set to be repaired. Furthermore, I was
											in charge of the organization and maintaining of the dataset of hundreds of 3d models, and much of my
											work involved pre and post processing of the objects and models. My efforts there culminated in writing
											and being named an author on the project's dataset paper which earned acceptance at the IEEE/CVF 
											Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, the highest ranking computer science venue
											in the world, and the 4th most cited research publication. This project was incredibly influential in
											my development as a computer science student, and only grew my appreciation for the development of
											and effort working with large datasets, as well as the beauty in drawing meaningful 
											insights from incredibly dense and intensive forms of data.
