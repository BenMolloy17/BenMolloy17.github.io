						<h2> When not coding, I spend the majority of my time  <br />
						a love for working with software, and quickly searched for opportunities to apply that passion.
						</h2>
						<p>During my sophmore year, I joined a Computer Vision and Machine Learning lab at Clarkson called the 
						<br /> 
						Terascale All-Sensing Research Studio (TARS). It was there that I developed a love for working with data,
						<br /> 
						and discovered the satisfaction of being able to draw logical conclusions and make meaningful analyses
						<br />
						from large data. Since graduating college and moving to Denver, I have paired my efforts on personal projects
						<br />
						with relaxing weekends away exploring the Colorado front range climbing scene.

											<h3>National Outdoor Leadership School</h3>
										</header>
										<p>At the age of 10, I first walked into my local climbing gym for my birthday party, 
										though if you asked me at the time I would have never gone back. However, at the suggestion
										of my father I eventually returned, and slowly he helped me foster a love for rock climbing 
										that persists to this day. When I was 16, after 5 years of absorbing all the technical knowledge I could
										from the outdoor guides who ran the climbing gym, I embarked on a 30 day rock climbing and backpacking trip 
										with the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) in the backcountry of the Wind River Range in WY.
										While 5 years of outdoor climbing had prepared me well for the technical goals of the course, 
										the trip was incredibly influential in my development as a leader, team member, problem solver and critical thinker,
										and provided me with the confidence, personal and team skills, and drive to excel not only in my 
										climbing, but in my professional endeavors as well.</p>

											<h3>Clarkson University Outing Club</h3>
										</header>
										<p>When I enrolled at Clarkson, it was not the engineering program that truly drew me to the small
											university in Upstate New York. Instead, I was enthralled when I met the university's Outing Club,
											and the seemingless endless number of likeminded outdoor enthusiasts. Coupled with the location,
											which was only a few hours north of my local Adirondack Mountains, the Outing Club provided the perfect
											respite from the stresses of college. In addition, it allowed me an opportunity to continue my favorite
											aspect(?) of climbing, which was teaching others about safely and efficiently climbing in the outdoors.
											I immediately began teaching fellow club members the guiding, climbing, and rescue skills that
											I had learned, before being elected as one of the officers for the climbing
											cage of our club. In conjunction with that, I worked as a route setter at our university's
											new climbing wall, continuing my love for sharing climbing with every new climber who walked through 
											the door.</p>
