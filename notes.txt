Notes from meeting with MOM and DAD:
Get a headshot at some point
Reorder the "3 parts" so that research and personal projects come before outdoor enthusiast
Find a descriptor (when the time comes) for personal projects instead of that (practical/applied application?)
Change the welcome descriptor for main page to like an about me maybe?
Perhaps have all personal projects on a different page?
Maybe have one page of "professional development" and one page of "personal development" like climbing etc
On a "professional development" page, three checks could be personal projects, undergraduate research and "continuing education" for certificates
This could replace the "candidate in three parts" with "Research | Projects | Education"
Rework opening, lose the "recent grad" and replace "passion" with skills
Remove mention of mechanical engineering, mention that robotics helped develop your interest in software
Rework the mention of "rock and ice climbing" in "during my sophmore year" paragraph, to not put it ahead of software passions
"Justify" the text below broken object etc
Maybe name the personal page About Me
Make some big paragraphs more concise, more natural and less "professor"-y
